# Parallel-Processing-Huffman

    This project is a passion idea I came up with awhile back with hopes of trying to learn more about the applications of introducing parallel procressing techniques and structures while learning c/c++ programming. With this project, I hope to introduce parallel processing into the encoding and decoding process, creating compressed files that can only be decoded with programs that recognize the break I will be introducing in between every ~ N/M characters, where N is the total compressed file size and M is the total number of threads I will evaluate the program on. Given that we will be able to split up the encoded character base into M groups and result in a compression time Mx times faster than a general huffman encoding counterpart.
